# zomboid-craftable-light-fixtures
Craftable Light Fixtures in Project Zomboid.
Craft the basic indoor and outdoor wall lamps, as well as the basic table lamps.
I decided not to include the open sign or industrial lights so that it still feels rewarding to find/collect these.

Each lamp requires 2 electrical skill, a screwdriver and hammer, and the following materials:
- aluminium
- electrical scrap
- electrical wire
- light bulb (white)
